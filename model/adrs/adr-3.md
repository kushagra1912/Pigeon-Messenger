# ADR3 - Frontend requirements

Date: 19/05/2024

Status: Accepted

# Summary

During our latest meeting, we decided that in interest of time and marking criteria, we will be not be working on the front end of the application as our top priority as we believe that it is a nice to have as opposed to a must have for meeting the Architecturally Significant Requirements of the project which are as follows -

1. Security
2. Reliability
3. Availability
4. Scalability

# Context

One of the most significant influence for this decision was simply the fact that we have a three week time constraint for the project's completion. After having set personal deadlines and distributing our work across one week sprints, we realized that the group effectively has only two weeks to implement the entire MVP and the last week for video presentation and the report.

Another influence for the decision is the marking criteria being used for grading our project. The marking criteria focuses more on testing ASRs of the project and the architecture. This makes us more incentivized to focus on delivering with the testing and critiquing the final architecture that would be delivered at the end of the project deadline.

# Decision

While an argument can be made that making a basic front-end doesn't take a lot of time, but saving time on the front-end implementation, we will be able to spend more time on the more valuable aspects of the project including delivering on our primary ASR being Security. 

# Consequences

The impact of the decision is that visually, it makes things tougher to understand as having a front-end allows the user to focus primarily on the application layer of the system as opposed to the business logic layer running behind scenes. This does help in making the implementation a lot more easier to achieve as now we have more spare time to work on security and testing.
